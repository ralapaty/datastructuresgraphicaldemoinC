                  Introduction to data structures
                  *******************************
        The efficiency,clarity and complexity of a programme
for  the  solution of a given the selected  data structures.
It  is the  purpose  of  this  project  to  present the most
important data structures,to explain concepts with graphically.
Under what conditions which data structures can be used most
effectively and to indicate which programming techniques are
most desirable for working with a particular data structure.

        This project "Introduction To Data Structures" explains
concepts of data structures,searching and sorting techniques
with graphically for better understanding to who are beginners
of data structures.

        In the study of data structures, it is necessary not
only to define the  concept of a data structure  itself  but
also state how the data structure can be stored and manipulated,
with this purpose in mind, several considerations are appropriate.
First,using the general definitions of the concept of a data
structure  and  illustrating  the  concepts with graphically.
Methods of storing structures can be presented.

        The actual description of algorithms for manipulating
data structures stored in a computer is given using 'c' language.
 
The main feature of this project is the user can input his/her
relevant data for illustrations.
 
About Project
-------------
The purpose of this project "Introduction To Data Structures"
is better understanding concepts of data structures and its
manipulations.

  	This project explains most important data structures
and its operations step by step with graphics. This  project
also explains most important searching and sorting techniques
with graphics.

        The selected data structures and searching and sorting
techniques are linear search,binary search,linear sort, binary
sort and insertion sort, singly linked list,doubly linked list,
stack,queue and its operations, binary tree and its traversals,
infix to prefix,infix to post fix conversions and evaluation of
postfix expression. All these explained with graphics.

        The actual definition of structures  and algorithms and
concepts is provided in online help.

        The project has  many features to be used with friendly
environment. This  project provides  graphical  user  interface
environment so the user can use this software  very  easily. In
this project all menus provided with  hotkeys. The  hotkeys all
are underlined for easy recognition.  The  user  can  select an
option  with  up/down  arrow  keys  followed  by  enter  key or
appropriate hotkey.
  
By using of this software the users definitely get better idea
about particular data structure and its operations.
